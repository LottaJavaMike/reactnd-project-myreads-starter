## Overview

The app has 3 book sections (Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read). You can select which shelf to add a book or remove a book altogether. You can search for books by clicking the green + button in the right corner and then add a selection to a shelf.

### What do I do from here?

You can fork it or clone it from gitHub.

Once you have the repo:
1.install all project dependencies with npm install
2.start the development server with npm start
